# CHEM3580 Jupyter Notebooks
A collection of exercises and comp Chem labs for CHEM3580 at the University of Newcastle

* h2_frequencies - Lecture 1. How good is a harmonic bond stretching potential?
* harmonic_vs_morse - Lecture 1. Are there better options to harmonic bond stretching potentials?
* twisting_carbenes - Lecture 1. Generate your own bond angle potential!
* H2_phasespace - Lecture 2. What is phase space, and why is it important for molecular dynamics?
* NPT_water_convergence - Lecture 2. What are the relationships between energy, velocity, temperature and pressure in an NPT ensemble? And how do we control them?
