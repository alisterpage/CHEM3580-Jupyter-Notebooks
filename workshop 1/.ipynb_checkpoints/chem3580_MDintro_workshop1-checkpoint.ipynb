    "As we have seen in the lectures for this section of the course, MD (molecular dynamics) is an extremely powerful tool for simulation the structure, behaviour and properties of colloid and interface systems. The practical component of this section consists of a series of computer labs where you will be using MD to simulate various condensed phase phenomena, and connecting your results to concepts in other parts of the course. \n",
    "\n",
    "The practical method we will be using for these workshops is the (very popular) Python programming language, via (also very popular) Jupyter notebooks. A *great* introduction to Python and Jupyter is provided [here](https://github.com/praiteri/TeachingNotebook/blob/main/introductionToPython/introductionToPython.ipynb), and working through this introduction would be great preparation for these workshops.\n",
    "\n",
    "In each workshop, you will be provided with a Jupyter notebook file, like this one, that explains the aims and expectations of the workshop. The notebook file also includes Python code that you can use as a *template* for your own simulations in the workshop. You will be expected to adjust the python code to your own purposes - note though that you will not need any former experience with Python for these workshops.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be running the notebooks on cloud-based servers (instructions available on the CHEM3580 canvas site), where all of the necessary Python software is pre-installed for you. You *should* be able to simply switch your virtual machine on and run the notebooks without any issues. However, if you are keen you can try installing Python and Jupyter on your own device - it is totally free and open-source. You will quickly understand why these computational tools are rapidly becoming the most widely used in science for modelling and data analysis!!"
