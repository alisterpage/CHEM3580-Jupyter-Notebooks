    "Water is the most common and important chemical solvent - it is not only central to life, it plays a critical role in colloid, interface and soft matter systems. Solvents such as water are typically handled in MD simulations via distinct force fields called _**solvent models**_, designed specifically to describe a solvent environment around a solute (e.g. micelle, polymer, protein) as accurately and efficiently as possible. Solvent models constitute a distinct group of MD force fields – they consist of parameters that are optimized to reproduce specific experimental properties of that particular liquid, such as density, enthalpies of vaporization and self-diffusion coefficients. \n",
    "\n",
    "As with any MD simulation, to simulate liquid water we must provide information about each water molecule’s initial position and velocity, as well as the forces that water molecules exert on each other. However, solvent water models involve additional parameters, such as whether each water molecule is flexible, or held fixed (and if so, what the geometry of each water molecule is), how the charge is distributed within each water molecule, and how each water molecule interacts with those around it via van der Waals interactions. Each of these parameters greatly affect how physically realistic the water model’s characteristics are. Each different water model will therefore have its own successes and weaknesses. \n"

    "A perfect model of liquid water would use quantum mechanics to exactly solve the system's Schrödinger equation, an impossible task, even on modern computers. Instead, assumptions are made to create water ‘models’ designed for different purposes to speed things up. Water models generally fix the geometry of individual molecules and replace their H and O atoms with point charges and describe van der Waal interactions via a simple Lennard-Jones potential. In other words, the energy of water is described by, \n",
    "\n",
    "$$E_{ab} = \\sum_{i}^{i \\in \\text{mol. A}}\\sum_{j}^{j \\in \\text{mol. B}}\\frac{k_C q_i q_j}{r_ij} + \\frac{A}{r_{OO}^{12}} - \\frac{B}{r_{OO}^{6}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that this expression does not depend on the distance between H and O atoms in the **same** water molecule. This means that the geometry in each water molecule is fixed. The total interaction between pairs of water molecules using this model therefore arises from 3 sites, and is just the sum of their electrostatic interaction (the first term), and their van der Waals interactions (the 2nd and 3rd terms). The latter is assumed to arise only from the oxygen atom. \n",
    "\n",
    "Simulating liquid water with 3-site water models therefore only requires **4 parameters** ($q_{O}$, $q_{H}$, $A$ and $B$) - this makes MD calculations extremely efficient. However, since there are only 4 parameters, water models are notoriously inflexible. For instance, values of $q_{O}$, $q_{H}$, $A$ and $B$ that give an accurate prediction of one property, such as water density, may give an inaccurate prediction of the heat of vaporisation. In the Table below, TIP3P and SPC/E are both examples of 3-site water models - we will be using TIP3P in this workhsop. \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most popular attempts to solve this problem is to introduce \"fake\" atoms into the water molecule structure. These fictitious **dummy atoms** (\"M\") atoms have no mass, but a non-zero charge. They are generally placed near the oxygen atom, effectively changing the water molecule's dipole moment - and therefore the  electrostatic and van der Waals interactions between pairs of water molecules. Effectively the presence of the dummy atom in this water model mimics, in a crude way, the presence of the oxygen lone electron pairs. Such \"4-site\" water models rely on **5 parameters** ($q_{O}$, $q_{H}$,$q_{M}$, $A$ and $B$), so have an increased degree of flexibility and can predict some properties of liquid water more accurately. However this comes at the cost of (1) having to determine what the charge on the dummy atom M is, and where it should reside in the water molecule (see **r(OM)** in the table below). More importantly, the inclusion of an additional atom in the force field means that MD simulations will be slightly less efficient. In the Table below, TIP4P-Ew, TIP4P/Ice, TIP4P/2005 and OPC are all examples of 4-site water models, each designed to predict some specific property of water (for instance, the parameters of the TIP4P/Ice model were specifically designed for simulating different phases of solid water). In this workshop we will examine the performance of TIP4P-Ew.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yet more advanced water models have also been developed, such as the 5- and 6-site water models. An example of the 5-site water model is shown below - instead of a single dummy atom M, 5-site water models incorporate a pair of dummy atoms (\"L\") that mimic more accurately the position of the oxygen lone electron pairs. 6-site models incorporate these lone pair dummy atoms and the 4-site dummy atom M together. The incorporation of multiple dummy atoms generally improves the prediction of these models, but with a significant increase in model complexity and simulation  efficiency.\n",

    "What are these two plots telling us? Firstly, looking at the evolution of simulation temperature vs time, we see that the initial temperature of the simulation is exactly 0 K - this is because our energy minimisation did not take into account thermal vibrations/motions of the molecules in the simulation. Once we start running the NPT-MD simulation itself, the temperature - very quickly - rises to ~298 K, which is the target temperature for ensemble. This is the effect of the **MD thermostat** that we have applied to the ensemble. In effect, the thermostat is forcing the motion of the atoms in the system to accelerate until the velocities of their velocities on average correspond to a constant value of 298 K. \n",

    "Having demonstrated that we have achieved an equilibrium NPT ensemble in the previous section, we can now see what this ensemble tells us about the structure of water itself. \n",
    "\n",
    "The two extreme scenarios of molecular interaction are solids, having molecules with strong interactions, which are aligned in a rigid crystal, and gases, having molecules with no to minimal interactions, with essentially no regular arrangement in their structure. The amount of interaction (and thus structure) of molecules in a liquid falls in the middle. This is one of the things that makes liquids so interesting - ***and the main reason almost all chemistry occurs in a solvent!***\n",
    "\n",
    "The structure in a liquid can be characterized by a radial distribution function (RDF), g(r). An RDF is a measure of the radial frequency of particles around some point in space. Typically, we use RDFs to measure the likelihood of finding an atom type (e.g. oxygen) around another atom type (e.g. hydrogen). For a monatomic gas, g(r) is flat, because any atom is a random distance from all other atoms. There is no preferred distance; all are equally likely. For a crystalline solid, g(r) has regular, sharp peaks, because atoms are regularly spaced from each other - you will be familiar with this from X-ray diffraction patterns. In a solid, only some distances are likely; others are essentially forbidden. \n",
    "\n",
    "Liquids, on the other hand, are structured locally but random at long range. This means a liquid g(r) resembles that of a solid at short-range, but that of a gas at long-range. Most liquids typically exhibit a few distinct short range peaks, these correspond to **solvation shells**. The position of these peaks indicate the length scale of each solvation shell, and the height of that peak indicates how pronounced the corresponding shell is in structure, relative to the surrounding bulk liquid environment. Eventually, as the nonlocal density becomes identical to the bulk density, g(r) flattens and tends to the bulk value of 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "For water, the amount of local structure can be characterized via the O-O, O-H and H-H g(r) functions (i.e. \"oxygens around oxygens\", \"hydrogens around oxygens\" and \"hyrogens around hydrogens\"), which are shown in the Figure below. This figure is produced via neutron diffraction measurements, however MD is also capable of producing RDFs. These RDFs show that: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. The hydrogen bonding structure in bulk water (i.e. the O-H g(r))  extends well beyond the first solvation shell (there are two hydrogen bond interactions at ~2 and 3.5 $\\mathring A$, respectively). \n",
    "1. The interaction length between neighbouring water molecules (via the O-O g(r)). The figure below shows that water arranges itself into ~3 distinct solvation shells at ~2.5, 4.5 and 7 $\\mathring A$, respectively. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, water is **really** structured!! Now that we understand this, we can begin to understand the physical and chemical properties of water, and why some of them change in the presence of solutes and interfaces (as we will see in the next workshop). "

    "Thermal fluctuations in a liquid cause a dissolved molecule to wander from its original position, executing a ‘random walk’. Eventually, the displacement of the molecule  is determined by its  **diffusion coefficient, D** (measured in area per time, e.g. m2/s). The diffusion coefficient is a proportionality constant, which relates the rate of diffusion of the molecule to that molecule's concentration gradient. Effectively, molecules and particles will move faster to a region where their concentration is lower (you know this already – drop some food colouring in water, and watch what happens!). \n",

That is, the self-diffusion coefficient of water is the diffusion coefficient of a single water molecule diffusing through bulk water. Mills determined the self-diffusion coefficient of water to be 2.299 $\\times$ 10$^{-9}$ m$^2$/s at 298 K (see the table below for the variation of this value with temperature). In terms of other solvents, water’s diffusion is similar to toluene (2.267 $\\times$ 10$^{-9}$ m$^2$/s) and higher than cyclohexane (1.1470 $\\times$ 10$^{-9}$ m$^2$/s).
