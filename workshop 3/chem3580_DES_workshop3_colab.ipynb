    "        To answer this question, we have to first look at the structures of urea and choline chloride.  First, let's consider choline chloride (ChCl) - the molecular structure of choline is shown on the right. Choline is positively charged via the protonated ammonium charge group. The electrostatic interaction between this part of the molecule and the Cl<sup>-</sup> anions causes ChCl to precipitate naturally as crystalline compound. Technically, it is just an organic salt - and as with most salts, its cations and anions are arranged in a regular ionic lattice due to the strong electrostatic interactions between them. \n",

    "        Given enough energy, it is possible to overcome these interactions - at which point the salt melts, or decomposes. For ChCl, this temperature is relatively low - only ~305 &deg;C - since the ion packing is far from ideal (for comparison, the melting point of NaCl is much higher, about 800 &deg;C). The fact that the cation is (1) large, (2) asymmetrical and (3) predominantly non-ionic (the charged part is located just on one end of the molecule) means that ion packing is \"frustrated\" - cations and anions don't pack particularly efficiently, and the electrostatic interaction between them  is much weaker than that present in NaCl. \n",
    "<br> <br>\n",
    "What about urea? The molecular structure of urea is shown on the right. It is a neutral compound, but nevertheless exists naturally as a crystalline material, just like a salt. The reason for this is the strong hydrogen bond network that forms between individual urea molecules, which results from the permanent negative dipole on the oxygen atom, the permanent dipoles on the amine hydrogens, and the fact that the molecule is planar and inflexible.\n",
    "        <br> <br>\n",

    "        While it is very well-structured, the urea lattice is not as stable as the ChCl lattice - it melts at around 130 &deg;C. This is because, as you already know, hydrogen bonds are weaker than electrostatic interactions, and it takes less energy to disrupt them.\n",
    " <br> <br>\n",
    "        Let's look now at the melting behaviour of <b>mixtures</b> of these two crystalline compounds. The image on the right shows the melting point of ChCl:urea mixtures for different amounts of urea (in mol%). Let's consider the melting point of ChCl (~305 &deg;C) in the presence of urea. The figure shows that as urea is added to ChCl, the melting point <b>drops</b>. This is a bit unexpected, but can be explained in terms of the intermolecular interactions at the interface between the two materials. As discussed above, the melting point of any salt is proportional to the strength of the electrostatic interactions between the ions - if anything disrupts these interactions, we can expect the melting point to become lower. In this case, urea molecules are disrupting the natural interactions between the Cl<sup>-</sup> anions and the positively charged ammonium head group in two different ways. Firstly, urea hydrogen amines enable <b>hydrogen bond donation</b> to the choline cation's hydroxyl oxygen atom, and also the Cl<sup>-</sup> anion. Secondly, the urea oxygen atom enables <b>hydrogen bond accepting</b> from the choline cation's hydoxyl hydrogen atom. Consequently, choline and Cl<sup>-</sup> electrostatic interactions now have to compete with choline-urea and Cl<sup>-</sup>-urea interactions. <b>The result of this is that the natural electrostatic interactions in ChCl become frustrated by urea,  and the melting point of the ChCl:urea mixture begins to drop</b>.\n",
    "        <br> <br>The figure shows that the melting point drops to a minimum of ~12 &deg;C for a ChCl:urea ratio of ~1:2. At this point, the melting point of the ChCl:urea mixture is lower than the melting points of both components. <b>This is the definition of a eutectic mixture</b> (see the generic phase diagram depicting eutectic melting point behaviour on the right).  \n",

    "To understand why DES are so important for colloid and interface science, we need to recall the main purpose of a chemical solvent. Obviously, solvents are used to <i>dissolve</i> certain molecules (solutes), thereby promoting their interaction. The outcome of this interaction could be a chemical reaction, producing new chemical compounds, a self-assembly process, producing new nanostructured or mesostructured materials etc. Alternatively, the outcome could be the reverse of these possibilities as well. Irrespective of the desired outcome, there is a strongly-held idiom in chemistry that <b>\"like dissolves like\"</b>. That is, if you are working with hydrophobic compounds - typical in organic and medicinal chemistry - you should use a non-polar solvent, e.g. hexane, chloroform etc. On the other hand, if your compounds are hydrophilic, you use a polar solvent (i.e. water), or adjust the polarity of the solvent via dissolved ions. In either case, it is assumed that the solvent environment is homogeneous.\n",

    "        The figure on the right schematically shows the \"space\" of chemical solvents in terms of these two parameters - the ionic content and the molecular polarity.  Examples of the extremes are found in the three corners of the plot - water (highly polar, but non-ionic), hexane (highly non-polar, but non-ionic), molten salts (highly polar and completely ionic). All solutions fall somewhere in between these extreme limits.\n",
    "    <br> <br>\n",
    "    In this context, we can see why DES are so important - DES span the majority of this solvent space, linking aqueous solvents, non-aqueous solvents, electrolytes and molten salts. By tuning the chemical components in the eutectic mixture DES are effectively <b>\"designer solvents\"</b> for practically any colloidal or interfacial process - they are therefore the most flexible class of solvents in chemistry, and hold particular importance for polymeric, colloidal and interfacial systems.\n",
